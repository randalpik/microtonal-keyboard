# Microtonal Keyboard

A keyboard for playing in just intonation.

To use, click a key to toggle it.

Blue keys are the flatter variants of white notes, typically reached by going down by fifths and up by fourths, instead of the other way around, when both options are close enough to the root note to be included. Red keys are the very flat dominant sevenths, related to the note a minor seventh lower by the "barbershop" ratio of 7:4.
